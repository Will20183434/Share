# Learning How to Learn

## Focused versus Diffuse Thinking
### Focused Mode
Tight Spacing -> help keep your thoughts concentrated
involve thinking about things you are somewhat familiar with

### Diffuse Mode
Wide Spacing -> more broad ranging ways of thinking
involve solving or figuring out something new

### How to Use Diffuse Mode Well
We all access this mode quite naturally when we do things like go for a walk or take a shower or even just drift off to sleep
The thing is it often takes time for **neural processing** to take place, and **time**, as well, to ***build*** the new neural structures that allow us to learn something now


## Chunking
### The Essentials
#### What is a Chunk?
> Chunks are **pieces of information,** neuroscientifically speaking, through **__bound together through meaning or use__**

A chunk means a network of neurons that are used to **firing together** 
so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively

#### How to Form a Chunk?
The best chunks are the ones that are **__so well ingrained__** that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together. 
> That actually is the point of making complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk
When you're first trying to understand how to work a problem, you have a heavy cognitive load

One concern about using worked-out examples to help you in starting to form chunks is that it can be all too easy to focus too much on **why an individual step works** and not **__on the connection between steps__**—that is, on why this particular step is the next thing you should do. 
##### [How to Form a Chunk steps by steps?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/sAVPZ/how-to-form-a-chunk-part-2)
- First, ***FOCUS*** your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.
- Second, ***UNDERSTAND*** the basic idea you're trying to chunk. 
Understanding is like a super glue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together. 
Then, do it! Just because you see it or even that you understand it, it does'nt mean that you can actually do it.Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underllie true mastery.  #输出
- Third, gain ***CONTEXT***, so you can see not just **HOW** but also **WHEN** to use the chunk.

> WHY -> HOW -> WHEN / WHERE
先有态度(问题、痛点、需求) -> 如何解决问题（目标导向管理） -> 落到实际业务、项目、情景中
适用于全部的事务中，可以作为原则存在 [Three Golden Laws #W19 #M5 ](https://dynalist.io/d/_0OgaiE3al0E7hUXd54an_Q3#z=HdNTHuGI_C2Qc2HG-6dJlcON)

Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and praciticing with both related and unrelated problems, so that you can see not only when to use the chunk, but when not to use it. 
This helps you see how your newly formed chunk fits into the bigger picture.
In other words, you may have a tool in your strategy or problem solving tool box but if you don't know when to use that tool it's not going to do you a lot of good.
- Finally, ***PRACTICE*** helps you broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to your chunk, ensuring it's not only firm but also accessible from many different paths.


#### Illusions of competence
- **RECALL**

Studies show that, by simply practicing and recalling the material, students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach.
> including simply **rereading** the text a number of times, **or drawing concept maps** that supposedly enrich the relationships in the materials under study.

You've done almost nothing to knit those concepts into your own underlying neural circuitry. 
Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the **most common illusions** of competence in learning

- Mini-testing

- Value of making mistakes
Is very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes real tests. 
Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit by bit 
mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.


### Seeing the Bigger Picture

> Chunked neural pattern is labeled as `元认知`

- The Einstellung Effect (固定思维MINDSET)

- Deliberate Practice
Balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. [刻意练习](https://dynalist.io/d/JvCwIChYdeoOXZ6Q0GBBXISa#z=QDtMRycIxHAXaJk8gipei-td)

- Interleaving
starts building flexibility and creativity.
The best way to learn that is by practicing jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies
Start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures.


## Procrastination
- REWARD
Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. 
It gives us an immediate little feeling of pleasure. 
Procrastination is an easy habit to develop because the reward, moving your mind's focus to something more pleasant happens so quickly and easily. 
But good habits can also be rewarded. 

`Finding ways to reward good study habits is important for escaping procrastination`

> `@曾思杰: `For LONG TERMS instead of SHORT TERMS

- Process vs Product
By focusing PROCESS rather than PRODUCT, you allow yourself to relax into the ***flow*** of the work.

- Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You
Eat your frogs first in the morning. 
Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first.

## Memory
Diving Deeper into Memory
Two methods help
1. Make connections ( make an OUTPUT) #输出 
Index cards can often be helpful (Anki)

2. Interval Repetition
Once you've given your cards a good try, put them away, maybe before you go to sleep.
Remember that sleep is when your mind repeats patterns and pieces together solutions.

Working memory's capacity
working memory which is like a whole blackboard they quickly fades. 
You can only hold about `four items` in your working memory.
